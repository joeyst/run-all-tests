# run-all-tests
Script for running CS381 lab tests in the terminal. Works for Lab 3, 4, and 5. 

Runs with one of the following:
- $ ./[script name]
- $ source [script name] 
- $ bash [script name]

If you receive the "Access Denied" message, enter "chmod 700 [script name]" and run the script again.

In order for it to work:
- you must *run* it from the directory that your lab file is in
- your lab file must be named "lab[number].[file extension]"
- your tests must be in the default folder that was in the starter pack

The script *itself* does not have to be in the directory that your lab is in.
